# Super Skyler RPG: Birth By Fantasy Megami Tensei Quest

This is a simple GUI version of a simple(r) text RPG system I made. I initially just wanted to brush up on C++, but I thought it'd be cool to learn some Qt and make a GUI for it. This was quite a challenge- Qt is obviously not meant for game development, and while SSR:BbFMTQ isn't complex, it's TECHNICALLY a game. Playing as a hyena hero tasked with slaying a dragon isn't really serious business to most people (to me, they should be friends).

Though, it's a little scuffed since this is my first time using Qt. I had a lot of fun doing stuff like making the sprites and adding audio. The sprites were actually meant to be placeholders (the "hero" text I quickly drew on the command box is funny lol), but I want to move on, so I'm leaving them as is despite their roughness. Everything else is sourced from Dragon Quest, Mother 2, Final Fantasy, or, my favorite RPG, Super Mario 64.

I might come back to this? I really wanted to add ~~RPG text scrolling (probably wouldn't have been too hard)~~ (I ended up adding this), some sort of timed hit minigame for more damage, and some minor details like spell effects, hurt sprites, etc. I think I'll save that for when I learn Godot, though!

You can easily play this by running ```SkylerRPG.exe``` in the release folder.
