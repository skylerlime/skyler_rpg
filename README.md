# Super Skyler RPG: Birth By Fantasy Megami Tensei Quest

Simple text RPG system I made one day for fun and to brush up on C++. Need to improve upon it and make the code more readable, but as of nowm, I Implemented attacking, magic, items, and "fleeing". Though, in the future, I do want to actually try and create some actual visuals.

To run, just clone the repo and run the exe (or just download the exe and music folder).
